Time Tracking
===

How It Works
---
Time Tracking is a Chrome Extension that reminds you to track your time throughout the day. Every 30 minutes a notification reminder will appear to remind you to track your time. You can select which projects you worked on in the past 30 minutes, and the extension will add an equal amount of time to each project. For example, if you worked on 3 different projects, it will add 10 minutes to each project. It keeps track of all of your time throughout the day, grouped by day. It displays a real-time summary so you can easily add your time to your timesheet at the end of the day, end of the week, or whenever is convenient. When you no longer need it, you can clear the timesheet and start fresh.

How to Install
---
You can install this via the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-tracking/mjcohamkemipmhnkfdboclamcihfmhgi?authuser=2

Adding & Deleting Projects
---
To add a project, simply add the project into the input box at the top and hit Enter. 

To delete a single project, click the X to the right of the project you want to delete.

To delete all projects, click the `Delete All Projects` button at the bottom.

Adding & Deleting Time
---
To add time, select the checkbox next to all projects you've worked on in the past 30 minutes, and click the `Submit Time` button. It will automatically divide the time up and add it to your running totals.

To delete time, click the `Clear Timesheet` button at the bottom.

**Warning: this will delete all of your time! Be sure you no longer need it, as you cannot get it back!**

This is currently v1. I realize there are some not-so-ideal things still, but I will be improving and adding things, so it will get better!
